## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to _PennyWise Savings App_, a fork of _GreenStash_, originally developed by Pool-Of-Tears and modified for our school project. The app helps users manage savings while providing access to external learning resources. While _PennyWise Savings App_ does not track or collect personal data, features like the Lessons tab require an internet connection and redirect users to third-party websites, which have their own privacy policies and practices.

PennyWise Savings App is primarily offline and does not require internet permission to function. All data is stored locally on your device and never leaves it. However, once you access external sites, their policies apply, and we are not responsible for their content or data collection. Users are advised to review these policies before proceeding.

This project is an independent modification of _GreenStash_, adapted to fit our requirements while maintaining its core functionality.
